Using gamma simulation platfrom, I created a model to simulate the in-house movement
and generate data collected by motion sensor.

The groundfloor is created/modified by simple drawing (I use windows painter)
with the wall in black color, PIR sensor position is indicated by red corlor.

PIR sensor has configurale attributes (range, angle, angle range)

Peole in house will move from room to room using A*Star algorithm.
